# ⚔️ ChoreQuest

> *Turn chores into quests, kids into heroes.*

A gamified family chore management app with full RPG theming. Parents create quests, assign them to kids with per-child schedules, and kids earn XP by completing them. Progress is tracked through streaks, achievements, a leaderboard, a daily spin wheel, and a treasure shop where kids spend earned XP.

## 🚀 Self-hosting

Built mobile-first as an installable PWA — bottom tab bar on phones and tablets, sidebar on larger screens. Supports **push notifications** so kids and parents stay in the loop even when the app isn't open.

### Run with Docker

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/ChoreQuest.git
cd ChoreQuest
```

Create a `.env` file (or pass env vars directly):

```env
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-min-16-chars
TZ=Europe/London
```

Then start:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The app runs on port **8122**. The first user to register automatically becomes the admin. After that, registration requires an invite code (generate them from the admin dashboard).

### Expose with Cloudflare Tunnel

ChoreQuest works great behind a [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/) — no port forwarding needed, free HTTPS, and it enables push notifications and PWA install on all devices.

```bash
# Install cloudflared (if not already installed)
# See: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/get-started/

# Create a tunnel
cloudflared tunnel create chorequest

# Route your domain to the tunnel
cloudflared tunnel route dns chorequest chorequest.yourdomain.com

# Run the tunnel pointing at ChoreQuest
cloudflared tunnel --name chorequest --url http://localhost:8122
```

> 💡 **Tip:** When running behind HTTPS (Cloudflare Tunnel, reverse proxy, etc.), set `COOKIE_SECURE=true` in your environment so auth cookies are sent correctly.

### Install as a web app

Once the app is accessible over HTTPS, everyone in the family can install it:

- **iOS Safari** — Tap the share button → *Add to Home Screen*
- **Android Chrome** — Tap the menu → *Install app* (or accept the install banner)
- **Desktop Chrome/Edge** — Click the install icon in the address bar

The app runs in standalone mode — no browser, just like a native app. The service worker caches static assets for fast loading and provides offline fallback pages.

## 🔔 Notifications

ChoreQuest has two notification layers that work together:

### In-app notifications (WebSocket)
Real-time updates delivered instantly while the app is open. The bell icon shows an unread count badge, and the dropdown panel lists all recent activity.

### Push notifications (Web Push / VAPID)
Notifications that arrive even when the app is closed — just like a native app. Supported on Android, desktop browsers, and iOS 16.4+ (when installed as a PWA).

**11 notification types:** quest assigned, quest completed, quest verified, achievement unlocked, bonus XP, trade proposed/accepted/denied, streak milestone, reward approved/denied.

#### Setting up push notifications

1. Generate VAPID keys (one-time):
   ```bash
   # Using openssl
   openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out vapid_private.pem
   # Or install a VAPID key generator (e.g. web-push library)
   npx web-push generate-vapid-keys
   ```

2. Add the keys to your environment:
   ```env
   VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=BExamplePublicKey...
   VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=your-private-key...
   VAPID_CLAIM_EMAIL=mailto:you@example.com
   ```

3. Users enable push notifications from **Settings → Notifications** in the app.

> 📌 Push notifications require HTTPS. Running behind a Cloudflare Tunnel satisfies this requirement.

## 🎮 For kids

- **Daily quest board** — see today's assigned quests in an animated card carousel, mark them done with a single tap (or attach a photo if proof is required)
- **XP and streaks** — earn XP for each verified quest, build a daily streak by completing all assigned quests. Current streak and longest streak are tracked. Streak resets if a day is missed
- **Daily spin wheel** — animated bonus wheel awarding 1–25 random XP once per day, unlocked only when all daily quests are completed/verified
- **Achievements** — 14 unlockable achievements: First Steps, Week Warrior, On Fire (7-day streak), Streak Master (30-day), Unstoppable (100-day), Piggy Bank / Money Bags / Point Millionaire (100/500/1000 lifetime XP), Early Bird (complete before 9 AM), Speed Demon (all done before noon), All Done!, Helping Hand, Treat Yourself / Big Spender (5/20 redemptions)
- **Treasure Shop** — browse and redeem rewards using earned XP. See pending/approved/fulfilled status in an inventory view
- **Wishlist** — add items with URLs, images, and notes. Parents can see wishlists and convert items into shop rewards
- **Quest trading** — propose quest swaps with siblings through the calendar. Target kid gets a notification and can accept or deny
- **Custom avatar** — SVG-based avatar editor with head shape, hair style, eyes, mouth, plus colour palettes for skin, hair, eyes, and background
- **PIN login** — log in with a 6-digit PIN instead of a password (handy for shared tablets)
- **Leaderboard** — weekly XP rankings showing each kid's weekly XP, lifetime XP, quests completed, and current streak

## 🏰 For parents

- **Quest Library** — browse all created quests in one place, search and filter by category and difficulty. Create new quests from scratch or from 24 built-in RPG-themed templates
- **Quest Assignment** — assign quests to specific kids with per-child settings:
  - Individual recurrence per kid (one-time, daily, weekly, custom days)
  - Per-kid photo proof requirements
  - Optional kid rotation with cadence (daily, weekly, fortnightly, monthly)
- **Active Quests tab** — view only quests that have active assignments, with hero count badges
- **Verification queue** — review and approve/reject completed quests from the parent dashboard, including photo proof viewing
- **Uncomplete / skip** — reverse a verification (deducting awarded XP) or skip a pending quest for the day
- **Bonus XP** — award ad-hoc bonus XP to any kid with a description
- **Rewards management** — create rewards with XP costs, stock limits, icons, and auto-approval thresholds. Approve, deny, or fulfil redemption requests
- **Family overview** — dashboard with kid cards showing today's quest progress, points balance, and current streak
- **Seasonal events** — create time-limited XP multiplier events (multipliers compound if multiple events are active)
- **Category management** — create, edit, and delete quest categories with custom icons and colours
- **Chore rotations** — rotate a quest between kids on a set cadence (daily/weekly/fortnightly/monthly) with manual advance option

## 🛡️ For admins

- **User management** — view all users, change roles (admin/parent/kid), activate/deactivate accounts
- **API keys** — generate scoped API keys with unique prefixes, track last usage, revoke keys
- **Invite codes** — generate registration codes with max uses and expiration dates. First user auto-becomes admin; subsequent users need a code (when public registration is disabled)
- **Audit log** — searchable log of logins, password changes, role changes, point adjustments, and other sensitive actions with timestamps, user IDs, and IP addresses
- **App settings** — configure daily reset hour, toggle leaderboard, spin wheel, and chore trading

### First run

The database, default categories (9), achievements (14), quest templates (24), and app settings are created on first startup. The first user to register becomes the admin. After that, registration requires an invite code by default — generate them from the admin dashboard.

### Data persistence

All persistent data lives in the `./data` directory (mounted as a Docker volume):
- `chores_os.db` — SQLite database (WAL mode)
- `uploads/` — photo proof files

Back up this directory to preserve all app data.

## 🔒 Security

- **PIN login** — 6-digit PIN for quick kid access on shared devices
- **JWT tokens** — short-lived access tokens (15 min default) with httpOnly refresh cookies (30 day default)
- **Token rotation** — refresh tokens are rotated on each use, old tokens revoked
- **Rate limiting** — login (10/5min), PIN (5/15min), registration (5/hour)
- **Security headers** — X-Frame-Options, Content-Security-Policy, Strict-Transport-Security, Permissions-Policy
- **Invite-only registration** — public registration disabled by default, admin generates invite codes with usage limits and expiration
